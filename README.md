# The Sleep Coach

A small simple device to help users fall asleep. The Sleep Coach was designed to be easy to manufacture, and the design and code are open source (see license at bottom).

## Features

* Creates a pattern of light that you match your breathing to
* Breathing rate is decreased during sleep, so this helps ease you into sleep faster
* The maximum brightness can be adjusted on-the-fly using the wheel potentiometer on the back
* One-button operation

## How to Use

* Set up the sleep coach on a night stand or table next to your bed.
* Turn on the sleep coach and adjust its angle to either shine in your eyes or on a wall or ceiling.

## Study

I have been conducting a study to collect data on the Sleep Coach to see if it actually helps users fall asleep.

So far I have had great success with the sleep coach, but I only have a sample size of 5 users. I'm always looking for more study participants!
